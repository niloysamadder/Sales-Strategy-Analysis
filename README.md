# Sales Strategy Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of three different sales strategies (**Email**, **Call**, and **Email + Call**) used to promote a new line of office stationery products launched 6 weeks ago. The objective is to determine the most efficient sales method for maximizing revenue while considering customer reach, effort, and outcomes. The analysis includes data validation, exploratory data analysis, statistical insights, and business recommendations.

   - Analyzed customer distribution, revenue trends, and product sales across the three sales methods.
   - Visualized key insights using bar plots, line charts, and scatter plots.
3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Identified relationships between website visits, revenue, and product sales.
   - Evaluated average order values (AOV) and revenue contributions of each sales method.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Proposed business metrics and strategies to monitor and enhance revenue growth.
